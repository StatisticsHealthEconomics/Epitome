# EPITOME

This is the GitHub repo for the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/)-funded project 'Evaluating Policy Implementations TO Predict MEntal health [EPITOME]: a Bayesian hierarchical framework for quasi-experimental designs in longitudinal settings'. 

EPITOME aims at developing methodology for the evaluation of the impact on mental health of policies such as the "hostile environment" and recent changes to the universal credit system, in the UK. Funding has been awarded by the Wellcome Trust for a total of Â£650,000 over four years and the research exploits a collaborative network across [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/).
